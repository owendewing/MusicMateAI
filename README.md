### 3. Run with Docker
```bash
# Build and start the application
docker-compose up --build

# The application will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Alternative: Development Setup

#### Using UV (Recommended)
```bash
# Install UV if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the backend
cd backend
uv run python main.py

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### Using Traditional Python
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the backend
cd backend
python main.py

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
